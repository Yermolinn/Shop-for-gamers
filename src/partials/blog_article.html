            The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.
            
            So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?
            
            Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic
            Gaming headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment. However, they possess
            qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval,
            accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
            
            However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment slots. You will need to
            get an external mic like the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
            
            A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the
            Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his games.
            
            There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones setup for gaming.
            
            Benefits of Gaming Headphones
            Higher upsides for audio and mic quality
            As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and mic itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup
            with the latest mic and headphones.
