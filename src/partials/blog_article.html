        Learn how to choose an amazing gaming headset with this checklist of just 9 surprisingly simple steps.

        Gaming headsets offer a handy and practical solution to any and all of your gaming audio needs. But, as with any
        kind of
        technology, there is a surplus of options on the market, and not all of them are worth buying.

        To make sure you get your money well spent, we’ve provided a checklist of the major factors or questions you
        should have
        answered. After you complete the checklist, you’ll have a much better idea on what to look for in a gaming
        headset

        9-Step Checklist to Pick an Amazing Gaming Headset

        Gaming Headphones vs Gaming Headsets
        What’s Your Gaming Platform?
        Wired vs Wireless Gaming Headsets
        Build Quality
        Noise Isolation
        Surround Sound
        Microphone
        Aesthetics
        Replacement Parts
        Price

        The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming
        headsets.

        So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?

        Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic
        Gaming headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment. However, they possess
        qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail
        retrieval,
        accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming
        headphones.

        However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment slots. You will
        need to
        get an external mic like the Blue Yeti X for communication support.

        A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He
        uses the
        Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his games.

        There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones setup for gaming.

        Benefits of Gaming Headphones
        Higher upsides for audio and mic quality
        As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and mic itself, you are able to assemble your
        gaming setup
        with the latest mic and headphones. There is potential for better overall audio and microphone quality.
