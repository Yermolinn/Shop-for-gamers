            Gaming Headphones = Regular 
            Headphones + Separate Mic
            Gaming headphones are regular 
            headphones that are used traditionally 
            for music enjoyment. However, they 
            possess qualities that are awesome for 
            gaming needs too. Audiophilic 
            characteristics such as great micro-
            detail retrieval, accurate sound stage 
            and immersive sound experience make 
            them feasible to double up as a pair of 
            gaming headphones.

                <p class="blog-article__text">
            However, most audiophile headphones 
            do not come with a mic nor do they have 
            any mic attachment slots. You will need 
            to get an external mic like the Blue Yeti 
            X for communication support.
